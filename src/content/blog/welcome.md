Welcome to the Humanyl blog, where we share our thoughts on building intelligent systems that work with intention.

## What We're Building

We're exploring how to create browser-native agents that learn from observation, adapt to context, and act with precision. This blog will document our journey, insights, and the challenges we face along the way.

## What to Expect

In the coming weeks and months, we'll be sharing:

- **Technical deep-dives** into our approach to agent design
- **Philosophical reflections** on the nature of intelligent work
- **Case studies** from our experiments and collaborations
- **Thoughts on the future** of human-AI collaboration

Stay tuned for more content as we continue to build and learn.
